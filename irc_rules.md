In order to maintain a friendly and safe environment on the IRC server, the following rules have been set in place:

# General rules
* Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TheDaedalusCrew/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Terms of Service](https://termsservicetemplate.com/live.php?token=53YDDvoUwIPiq3eegI73H7coSTzUj1Cz).
* These rules can be updated at any time, it is your responsibility to keep up to date with any changes.
Github offers various ways to keep up to date with changes.
* Do not send advertisements for outside services using PM without permission from a community leader.
* Do not flood the network with meaningless or repeated messages.
* Do not bypass channel, server or network bans.
* If a staff member asks you something in PM, respond. If you need to go, inform staff when you will be back to discuss the issue.
* Content published by users are the sole responsibility of those users.

# Official channels
* The following channels are official channels: #help
* Do not use bots on official channels.
* Do not write messages in ALL CAPS on these channels.
* Do not send advertisements for outside services on these channels.
* Be respectful to other users.
* Try to stay on topic in these channels.  
* Stay away from topics that may start "flame wars" such as religion or politics.
* Ignoring or purposely violating instructions from staff on these channels may result in network-wide penalties.
* Staff must act profesionally on these channels.

# Channel ownership
* Channels are owned by the person with the highest chanfix rank or whoever is set as owner in chanserv.
* Channels may not contain content forbidden by our code of conduct or content or terms of services that is against the law.

* Channel owners are required to ensure network rules are followed in channels and kick or ban those that do not follow them.
* If channel owners do not attempt to ensure network rules are followed in their channel, their channel registration may be dropped permanently.

# Bot rules
* Any client using automated scripts to interact with the server such as MIRC or Irssi scripts etc. also counts as an IRC bot and must follow these rules.
* IRC Bots may not also be used for regular chatting and need to be clearly marked as a bot by setting usermode +B. (/mode botname +B)
* IRC Bots may not communicate with or react to "users" that have usermode +B set.
* IRC Bots may not send PM's to users without an action by a user causing this PM.  
Example of good behaviour: User uses !help, so we send them a PM with information.)  
Example of bad behaviour: Bot sends a PM to everyone that is in a channel shared with the bot at 12PM to ask if they want to enter a survey.
* Whoever runs the bot needs to be online on IRC whenever the bot is.
* Whoever runs the IRC Bot is responsible of ensuring that the IRC Bot cannot easily be abuse and follows the rules.
If users can use the bot to send any form of messages it needs to be clear which user initialized the action.
* IRC Bots need to properly respond to ident requests with the nickname of the bot. Exceptions can be requested in #help.
* IRC Bots need to properly respond to CTCP VERSION requests with the name of the software used to run the bot.
* IRC Bots need to properly respons to CTCP OWNER requests with the nickname of the user that runs the bot or have another CLEAR way to indicate who owns the bot.
* If channel staff (+o or higher) requests you to remove a bot, you need to make sure the bot does not enter the channel or send messages to it.
* Private information (e.g. private logs, passwords, usernames, ip's etc.) collected by bots need to be stored securely. You must inform any breaches to Community Leaders and local and international privacy laws apply.
Open source bots are preferred and if we have reason to believe your bot may be insecure, we may choose to restrict access to features or restrict access to the network entirely for your bot.

## Channel logs
You are allowed to store or share channel messages without opt-in as long as you follow these rules.
* IRC Bots may not share channel or private message content over unencrypted networks. (So use https if you serve it online.)
* Private message content may only be shared if the user opts in and you must always inform the user of the fact you are sharing their messages before every conversation.
* You must inform channels if you keep or share logs of channels. Channel staff may choose to remove your bot from their channel based on this.
* Channel logs may not be kept on channels with channel modes +s or +p.
* Users may request their messages to be removed from logs, the bot owner must then remove all messages from this user from the logs.
* Users may opt-out of logs, when they do this, you may no longer log any of their messages.
